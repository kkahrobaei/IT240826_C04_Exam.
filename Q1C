1. Incorrect Cell References: Using the wrong type of cell reference (relative vs. absolute) can lead to errors in calculations when formulas are copied.

2. Not Using Data Validation: Failing to set up data validation can result in entering invalid data, which can skew results.

3. Overlooking Hidden Rows/Columns: Hidden rows or columns can lead to missing or mistakes in your data.

4. Ignoring Errors in Formulas: Not checking for formula errors (like #DIV/0! or #VALUE!) can lead to incorrect conclusions based on flawed data.

5. Neglecting to Save Changes: Forgetting to save your work regularly can result in losing your work due to crashes or accidental closures.
